            <p>
                Hello, everyone! Welcome to my website. My name is Kenneth. I was born and raised in Colorado. I
                graduated high school in 2019. I love doing all the things most Coloradans enjoy. I love hiking Red
                Rocks, going to various sporting events, and going to 16th Street. I have spent more time figuring out
                what I want to do with my life than most others. </p>
            <p>I enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2020 and served for
                three years. I separated from the Army to pursue a career in software development. I have been using
                resources like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, books, and YouTube to teach myself. If you have any tips or
                want to check out my projects and leave suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. Also, if you need a
                collaborator on a project, Iâ€™m your guy.
            </p>

                <h2>Quote Project</h2>
            </a>

            <p>
                This is a javascript project that takes a nested array of quotes and prints a quote from each array
                within the nested array.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this project, I learned about nested arrays and looping through nested arrays.
